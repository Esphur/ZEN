Drag and drop the ZEN folder into your mods folder.

Don't be a mong like Kael and rename it.

If your 4x is cooked to shit, this probably won't work so if your getting errors that's probably why.

Either do a clean 4x install or slot in the common_scripts folder into the mod folder.
Only use this as a last resort if your getting setping / void errors.

DLL is in here in case it's needed also.

This is a fork of auzziemod & Monaco by Simonlfc, it's currently a work in progress.
All credit to him for the amazing menus and thanks to Jebus for helping with all my stupid questions.
